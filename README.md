# instagram-post-automation
Automated Instagram posting tool built with Python. It uses a local HTTP server and ngrok to serve images online, then automates posting to Instagram via the Graph API. This project demonstrates API integration, automation, and error handling for seamless content publishing

Description:
This project is a Python-based tool designed to automate the process of posting images to Instagram using the Instagram Graph API. It involves setting up a local HTTP server to serve image files, exposing the server online using ngrok, and then utilizing the Instagram API to create and publish media posts with captions.

Key Features:

    Local HTTP Server: Serves images locally for testing.
    ngrok Integration: Exposes the local server to the internet, enabling remote access.
    Instagram API Integration: Automates image posting by creating and publishing media containers via the Instagram Graph API.
    Error Handling: Includes logging and debugging to handle API-related errors.

    Commands and Their Purposes

    Start ngrok:
        Command:

        bash

    ngrok http 8000

    Purpose:
    This command starts ngrok to expose your local server running on port 8000 to the internet. It provides a public URL that you can use to access your local server remotely.

Get ngrok's Public URL:

    Command:

    bash

    curl http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels

    Purpose:
    This command retrieves the public URL provided by ngrok, which you can then use to access your local server and its resources (e.g., images).

Run the Python Script:

    Command:

    bash

    python instagram_upload.py

    Purpose:
    This command executes your Python script that automates the process of uploading and publishing an image to Instagram using the Instagram Graph API.

Terminate ngrok (if running manually):

    Command:

    bash

    ngrok kill

    Purpose:
    This command stops the ngrok process if it's running in the background and you want to terminate the tunnel manually.

Check ngrok Version (for troubleshooting):

    Command:

    bash

        ngrok version

        Purpose:
        This command checks the version of ngrok installed on your system, useful for verifying compatibility and troubleshooting issues.

Purpose of Each Command

    ngrok http 8000: To expose your local server (running on port 8000) to the internet via a public URL.
    curl http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels: To retrieve the public URL generated by ngrok.
    python instagram_upload.py: To run your Python script that automates the Instagram posting process.
    ngrok kill: To manually stop the ngrok tunnel when you no longer need it.
    ngrok version: To check which version of ngrok you're using.

These commands collectively help set up your local server, expose it via ngrok, and then automate the process of posting an image to Instagram through the Python script you created.
